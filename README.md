### Human Vision

**Photoreceptors**
**Cones** - Are 6 million used inpresence of light, fovea has almost all cones present on retina 1.5mm
**Nods** - Are 120 million, For night vision, takes 7 minutes to adjust from light to no light and get activated.
**ganglia** It transmits information to brain, are 1 million

There are more than 30 substructure in brain to interpret visual data.
V1 - primary visual cortex - for edge detection,gets transferred to V2.
V2 - Secondary visual cortex - size, color, transfer to V3,v4,v5.

We dont know exactly how does the processiong of visula data takes place because its too complex.

**Action and storage on visual data**
Ventral system - long term stored, performs on identification and recognition from visual data, its stored as conscious memory
Dorsal system- very short term storage, performs on visually guided behavious, unconsious memory eg throwing a ball suddenly and we know how to defend.

**Note - Visual cortex is largest system of brain, 30% and lot of processing happens unconsciously **
